# Map WebApp Exercise

This is a project born only with the aim of practicing with the technologies of Spring Boot and Angular.
The user can enter the required data such as the region and the name of the property. There is also a map created thanks to Leaflet where for the moment it can only 'play', but its usefulness is expected very soon.

I'm trying to create a login, registration and forgotten password page so that the web app is as safe as possible.
 Also a way is in development to make my three API secure with API Key that will allow them to be used.
 
## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [Maven 3.8.5](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [MySQL Server 8.0.29](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- [NodeJS 18.2.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Run Locally

Clone the project with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or download the project zip and extract it wherever you want in your computer

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/khovakrishna-pilato/first-full-stack-app.git
```

First of all go to the spring-boot folder directory 

```bash
  cd first-full-stack-app-main/spring-boot
```

Start the server if you have Maven installed or go to spring-boot/target and launch JAR file: open http://localhot:8080 in your browser and skip the steps below

```bash
  mvn-spring-boot:run
```

Then go to the Angular folder directory 

```bash
  cd first-full-stack-app-main/angular
```

Install dependencies with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
  npm install
```

Install Angular 13.3.5

```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli@13.3.5
```

Start the client: the web app will open in the browser 

```bash
  npm serve -o
```
